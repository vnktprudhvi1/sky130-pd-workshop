**Overview**

In Intergrated Circuit (IC) design, physical design is the most challenging and core past of the cycle. Physical design follows next to circuit design. Physical Design is known as back-end design with RTL netlist, library information on the basic devices in the design and technology file containing the manufacturing constraints as the inputs and concluding with Layout Post Processing. Here a complete Physical Design is implemented using openlane flow, a fully-automated RTL2GDSII flow with the help of Google-SkyWater's open source 130nm PDK (process design kit).

 ## Day 1 : Understanding of OpenLane Flow, open source PDK files and running synthesis
 In day 1 we learnt the importance of Physical design and OpenLane flow to automate RTL2GDSII flow.
 The day started with the importance of Hardware discription languages, instruction sets and layouts in communication with computers and ended with the synthesis of picorv23 design  using yosys and abc
 
 **How to communicate with computers**
 The application software written using high level languages such as c,c++,java are compiled to instriction set (RISC-V core computer uses RISC-V ISA) assembly language. These instructions are converted to binary language and excecuted in layout. Hardware discription languages are used to implement the instructions which serves as an interface between layout and instruction set. In addition to Physical Design flow we also understand the importance and difference of Foundary IP's ans Macros

      Flop ratio = flop count/no.cells = 0.108429

##  Day 2 : Floor planing

Day 2 workshop focused on chip floor planning and placement, where we learnt about unitization facor, aspect ratio, pre-placed cells, de-coupling capacitors, need for libraries and characterization, cell design flow with the help of inverter and general timing perameters like threshold and propagation delay. Also gained an hands on experience by implementing floorplan and palcement for picorv32a design using OpenLane.

**Take aways of Day 2**

**1. Determaining aspect ratio :**

       Aspect Ratio = Height of the core /Weidth of the core
   * If aspect ratio = 1 (Chip is square) else (Chip is rectangle)
  
**2. Utilization Factor :**
  
       Utilization Factor = Area occupied by the netlist/Total area of the core
     
     
   * If all logic cells occupies the complete area of the core => Utilization factor = 1
  
**3. Preplaced cells :**
 
   * These cells are placed only once and reused multiple times

   * The automated placement and routing tools doesn't touch the locations of preplaced cells.

**4. Decoupling Capacitor :**

   * Gives power supply to preplaced cells locally, inorder to prevent undefined logic state.

**5. Power planing :**

   * Due to power supply at single place Ground Bounce and Voltate doop may be occures near placed cells and in buses to avoid that we can use power supply with multiple vdd and      vss lines, for example Mesh power planning.
  
 **6. Pin placement :**
 
   * Bigger the size smaller the resitance; clock paths should be least resistive. Therefore, clock pins are bigger in size
 
 **7. Flooplan :**
 
   * Standard cell placement happens in placement stage not in floorplan. Here chip dimensions are determained using size of logic less in the netlist.


 **8. Placement :**
 
   * Buffers are placed between inputs and cells to reduce the slew and save signal integrety.

   * We do abatement for some logic to reduce the time delay and to increase the performance for perticular section.   
 
 **9. Library characterization and modeling :**
 
   * Library has  standard cells with differnt functionalality, different sizes, different vth.
