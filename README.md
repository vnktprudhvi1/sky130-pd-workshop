**Overview**

In Intergrated Circuit (IC) design, physical design is the most challenging and core past of the cycle. Physical design follows next to circuit design. Physical Design is known as back-end design with RTL netlist, library information on the basic devices in the design and technology file containing the manufacturing constraints as the inputs and concluding with Layout Post Processing. Here a complete Physical Design is implemented using openlane flow, a fully-automated RTL2GDSII flow with the help of Google-SkyWater's open source 130nm PDK (process design kit).

 ## Day 1 : Understanding of OpenLane Flow, open source PDK files and running synthesis
 In day 1 we learnt the importance of Physical design and OpenLane flow to automate RTL2GDSII flow.
 The day started with the importance of Hardware discription languages, instruction sets and layouts in communication with computers and ended with the synthesis of picorv23 design  using yosys and abc
 
 **How to communicate with computers**
 The application software written using high level languages such as c,c++,java are compiled to instriction set (RISC-V core computer uses RISC-V ISA) assembly language. These instructions are converted to binary language and excecuted in layout. Hardware discription languages are used to implement the instructions which serves as an interface between layout and instruction set. In addition to Physical Design flow we also understand the importance and difference of Foundary IP's ans Macros

 * Configuration directory
 
 This directory has .tcl files that are used for default perameters

 * picrorv32a directory 
 
 This is the design we are implementing OpenLane flow
 
 This directory has src file, SCL, and config.tcl where we can overwrite the default configurations
 
 runs directory is added after initiating the flow.
